		<h3>"I Am What I Am"</h3>
		<p>Mark Howard aka howie born is a web designer, developer and programmer. </br>
		I Studied Information Technology majoring in Information Systems at the University of Queensland. </br>
		If i'm not solving web design problems or reading about new and creative ideas and techniques, 
		then you can usually find me strumming away on my guitar or making loops on my computer. </br>
		I also love spending time outdoors doing some form of sporting activity, surfing, snowboarding, etc. 
		Not too big into watching TV, but would rather chat to mates or read a good book. </p>
